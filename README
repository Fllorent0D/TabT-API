== TabT ==

TabT provides a complete and powerful software suite to access and manage results of matches,
tournaments and competitions of table tennis.

See http://tabt.frenoy.net for more information


== The programming interface (API) of TabT ==

To allow developpers and creative webmasters integrating data gathered in the TabT software,
TabT provides a generic programming interface (in short "API") that can be used from any
language and any platform.

Everbody can consequently create his/her own application (club results management, tournament
software, ...) or website (for his/her own club) based on the powerful TabT engine.
